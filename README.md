The aim of the project is to isolate, sequence and assemble genomes of actinomycete strains derived from soil. As such, I expect we will perform the following lab-work:
- Isolation of actinomycetes from soil (should be covered by microbiological background)
- Growth of cultures
- Extraction of HMW DNA
- QC of DNA quality
- Oxford Nanopore Sequencing

The sequencing will be performed primarily by
