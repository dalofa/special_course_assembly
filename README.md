# special_course_assembly
The aim of the project is to isolate, sequence and assemble genomes of actinomycete strains derived from soil. As such, I expect we will perform the following lab-work:
- Isolation of actinomycetes from soil (should be covered by microbiological background)
- Extraction of HMW DNA
- QC of DNA quality
- Oxford Nanopore Sequencing

In addition to the lab work, the course will involve the following analysis work:
- Genome assembly
	- Using Flye (and perhaps Trycycler) to generate genome assemblies [insert links]
	- Annotating assemblies using Bakta [insert link]
	- Evaluating the quality of assemblies using BANDAGE and BUSCO
- Structuring analysis work using scripts
	- Navigating a terminal and automating small tasks using BASH
	- Plotting using R/Python
